a) generally reduces performance in class 1 and especially the take-off weight
b) does not influence performance in class 1 and especially not on the take-off weight
c) increases performance in class 1 and especially the take-off weight
d) increases or does not influence take-off weight depending to aircraft type
 A
339. Assuming an engine failure has occurred during take-off, a Performance Class 1 helicopter which plans a turn in the climb of more than 15Â° must be capable of clearing vertical obstructions by an extra:
a) 3 m
b) 7R
c) 15 ft
d) 35 ft
 C
340. Assuming one engine inoperative in a helicopter with Performance Class 1, during an approach to land, the following minimum rate of climb must be achievable:
a) At 150 ft 1000 ft/min
b) At 60 m 100 ft/min
c) At 150 ft 300 ft/min
d) At 200 ft 60 m/sec
 B
341. Assuming that an engine fails at some point during take-off, a helicopter of Performance Class 1 must be able to clear all obstacles, vertically, by:
a) 10.7 ft in VFR
b) 35 m in IFR
c) 35 m in VFR
d) 10.7 m + .01 DR in IFR
 D
342. Define the term "Performance Class 1".
a) Performance Class 1 operations are those operations such that, in the event of critical power unit failure, performance is available to enable the helicopter to safely continue the flight, except when the failure occurs early during the take-off manoeuvre or late in the landing manoeuvre, in which cases a forced landing may be required.
b) Performance Class 1 operations are those with performance such that, in the event of failure of the critical power unit, the helicopter is able to land within the rejected take-off distance available or safely continue the flight to an appropriate landing area, depending on when the failure occurs.
c) Performance Class 1 helicopters means multi-engine helicopters based on a critical engine failure concept which assures performance capability for continued safe flight in the event of an engine failure.
d) Performance Class 1 operations are those operations such that, in the event of a power unit failure at any time during the flight, a forced landing may be required in a multi-engine helicopter but will be required in a single engine helicopter.
B
343. In performance class 1, having cleared the elevated heliport or heliplatform's edge, in case of an engine failure after the take-off decision point, the helicopter can clear any obstacle until the end of the take-off required distance with a margin of:
a) 35 ft
b) at least 15 ft vertically
c) at least 35 ft
d) at least 35 ft vertically
 D
344. In performance class 1, with one engine failed and the others operating normally, the helicopter's weight at the estimated time of landing must be such that a rate of climb of at least 100ft/mn at 200 ft above the altitude of:
a) the destination heliport
b) the destination or alternate/diversion heliport
c) the take off heliport
d) the alternate heliport
 B
345. In performance class 1, with one engine failed and the others operating normally, the helicopter's weight at the estimated time of landing must be such that a rate of climb of at least 150ft/mn at 1000 ft above the altitude of:
a) the destination or alternate/diversion heliport
b) the destination heliport
c) the alternate heliport
d) the take off heliport
A
346. In performance class 1, when the wind measuring equipment has not received official approval, and there is a headwind component, to determine landing performance an operator may take account of at:
a) most, 50% of the reported headwind component
b) most, 80% of the reported headwind component
c) most, 40% of the reported headwind component
d) least, 50% of the reported headwind component
 A
347. Performance such that, in the event of failure of a critical power unit, enables a helicopter to land within the rejected take-off distance available is:
a) Performance Class 2.
b) Performance Class 4.
c) Performance Class 3.
d) Performance Class 1.
