Which of the following statements is correct with respect to this flight?|Due to Earth convergence, the track direction will continuously decrease during the flight.|Convergence decreases with increasing latitude.|Due to the increase in latitude, the final track angle at the destination will be higher than at the departure.|As great circle tracks are plotted as straight lines, they do NOT have a changing track direction.|1
